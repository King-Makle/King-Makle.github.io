        		What makes a good role model? I belive its someone that has characterstics that you would like to emulate.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		The rolemodel that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Smart - self explanatory</li>
        		<li>Challenge The Proccess - just becuse its the way people say doesnt men thats best</li>
        		<li>Successful - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Sacrifice &amp; commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		.Jordan Belfort was extremely suscful do to his ability to challenge the process, although this landed him in quite a bit of trouble but led the way for some major reforms on wallstreet.
